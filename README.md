<h3>datavisualization_metagenomis </h3>

R scripts to generate bar plots with metagenomics data.

install R and R studio

The count data representing taaxonomic or functional output from taxonomic and functional profiling of metagenomic data is used to generate the visual comparison between samples.

figure1.R generates a single stacked bar plot and a legend, applicable for observations at phylum level or at class level when the number of observed categories are few. 

figure2.R generates a stacked bar plot and a seperate legend, applicble when you want to look at large number of categories mostly seen at a genus or phylum level.

figure4.R generates a bar plot of catetgories, applicable to visualize functional profile at a certain level and to visually compare various categories within one or more systems.
